# SaaS Landing Page - Frontend Project

This is a modern, responsive SaaS landing page built using **Next.js**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and animated using **Framer Motion**. It serves as a professional landing page for a Software as a Service (SaaS) product.

## 🚀 Project Purpose

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Animations**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
